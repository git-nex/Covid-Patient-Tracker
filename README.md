# Covid_Vaccine_Tracker
Countrywise realtime vaccine tracker for both partial and full vaccination status


First, created an array using numpy from a csv which shows vaccination status of each and every country. 
Selected some of the countries to start with .Then plotted the Graph of those selectd countries using 
matplotlib as shown in the image below.



Reading of data becomes much easier by using graphs to quickly analyze the state of pandemic in countries.



Python libraries Used - Numpy , Pandas and Matplotlib

1. NumPy-
By using NumPy we have written the code to store
data of no. of vaccinated, total population etc.

2. Pandas-
By using Pandas, we have converted the data into
excel which was stored using NumPy.


3. Matplotlib-
By using Matplotlib we have plotted three types
graph of the above data.
● After that we have also written code of new
data entry
● Than after that all data is printed in a particular
format
